# GPU Accelerated Numerical Engine for Nucleation & Growth
This project is a GPU-accelerated parallel simulation framework implemented in CUDA/C++, designed to solve large-scale time-dependent field evolution problems.

The code focuses on efficient kernel design, memory optimization, and scalable time-stepping, and can serve as a template for high-performance numerical simulations and ML system workloads.
